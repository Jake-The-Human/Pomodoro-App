# Pomodoro-App

Pomodoro timer is a time management idea to help people focus on a task.
The basic idea is that you have some amount of time you will focus, in this app the default is 25 minutes. Then after that you have a break, the default here is 5 minutes. You do this for a certain amount of times here its 4 times then you take a long break. After that you start over until your task is done.
